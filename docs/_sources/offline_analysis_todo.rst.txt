Offline Analysis TODO
=====================

 - Inventory captured data, make pulsar acquisitions.

     - This may be helpful: :ref:`Making an acquisition`
                            

 - Understand Miles' framework for forecasting SNR.

 - Set up offline scripting framework for reproducing SNR values in database, comparing with forecasts.

 - Incorporate detrending correction.  Can we use less detrending?  (in real-time pipeline?  in offline analysis of bright pulsars?)

 - Overclipping studies.  What happens in simulation?  If we dedisperse the mask, do we see peaks?

 - Simulating a pulsar.  Are bonsai's SNR estimates still unbiased if pulses are repeating (rather than isolated)?

 - Variance estimation.  How should we be weighting the channels?  Is the radiometer equation satisfied?

 - Related: estimating the spectrum of the pulsar.

 - Pulsar masker/unmasking transform.

 - Determining arrival times of pulses (either through external ephemeris or internal analysis).
